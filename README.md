* Socket.io
### Deployment: 
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Container Service (ECS)

### AWS ECS

We have utilized the following applications in AWS ECS:

* AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) - We pushed our docker image to an ECR registry repository and leveraged the image version control provided by ECR (similar to Git).
* AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) - We employed ECS to create and execute our service for our task definition containing the running Docker Image retrieved from AWS ECR Repository.
* Application Load Balancer - We employed an Application Load Balancer to regulate in-bound traffic and direct it towards one of the two active tasks for our ECS Service, as well as to conceal the Public IP of the ECS server instance and the PORT NUMBER it is listening to.

### MongoDB Atlas

We have used the NoSQL database service of MongoDB as the database for our app.

As a whole, the free credits from AWS, as well as their detailed documentation has helped us to deploy our project to be used for public use. We are grateful to AWS for helping aspiring developers like us to realise our potentials
